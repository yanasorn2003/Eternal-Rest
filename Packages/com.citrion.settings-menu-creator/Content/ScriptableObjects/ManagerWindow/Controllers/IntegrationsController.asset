  description: Below you find a list of integrations for other assets. In most cases
    they add files to the project which add extra functionality or make the compatibility
    between the asset and the Settings Menu Creator easier. This could for example
    be new settings for the third party asset or prefabs containing visuals so they
    can be immediately used with the Settings Menu Creator without additional set
    up. They will usually be imported to Assets > CitrioN > SMC > Integrations. If
    you think a certain asset should have an integration please join the discord
    and create a feature request for it. If you are an asset publisher and think
    an integration between our assets would be useful to our customers please reach
    out to me.
